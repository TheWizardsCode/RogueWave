This is a fun, 7 Day (ish) project, starting on Dec 20th 2023 and ending Dec 29th 2023. Yes, that's more than 7 days, but there are important family events in this period for many of our community.  It is designed to allow us to try out some new gamedev skills. This is a not a competitive game jam, it's a collaborative learning experience.

It is fun and educational for all. 
We work together on a single project. 
We don't demand things of others, but we do help others to get involved. 
It doesn't matter what you skills are we can use them, even if you have never opened Unity before you can contribute (we need testers)

We will only be using a single paid asset, the wonderful [NeoFPS](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/neofps-fps-controller-template-toolkit-150179?aid=1101l866w&utm_campaign=unity_affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=partnerize-linkmaker), however, even if you don't own that you will be able to contribute (testing, art, modelling, sound etc.)

Note that all assets produced as part of the sprint will be made available on GitHub as MIT licensed open source or CC0 assets as appropriate. You will retain copyright in your work but must make it available to us under these licenses to facilitate open collaboration.

To get involved just click "Interested" below and, ideally, reply to this thread and provide a quick intro describing what you are looking to learn and how you can contribute. You can find some information about how to ‚Å†[Get Involved](https://discord.com/channels/728852904978415676/1185689608994955294) on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qpemytCd98).
