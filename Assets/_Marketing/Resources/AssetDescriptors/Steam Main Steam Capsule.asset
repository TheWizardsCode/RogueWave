    Design: For best results, please use the key art and logo
    that is being used for any retail boxes or marketing. The art used for them should
    immediately tell the customer something important about the game. It should be
    graphically-centric and give the user some sense of the game-play.

    Do not
    include quotes or other strings of text beyond the title of your game.

    The
    game''s logotype should be easily legible against the background.



    Size:
    Please provide ''920px x 430px'' . Smaller versions will be generated from this.



    Note:
    Generally, this artwork should not change. If you want to include text about
    major game updates, tournaments, or other time-sensitive events on your capsules,
    then Artwork Overrides will allow you to upload bespoke capsule images to market
    something specific in your game, and then have those special images automatically
    expire after a set timespan.'
