  script: "Wonderful, you have gathered the first specialist crystal. But we need
    others. \n\nThe natives have figured out what we are up to. They want to stop
    us. They've enabled spawners in each zone and will likely send in waves of enemies
    to protect their resources. \n\nWill you focus on offense. defense or a combination
    of both? Will you seek to improve yourself or will you power up your nanobot
    equipment?\n\nIn all likelyhood a balance of both approaches may be best, but
    it's your choice."
