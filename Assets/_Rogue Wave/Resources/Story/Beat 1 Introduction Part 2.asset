  script: "When you are ready we'll send you out there to take a look around. \n\nUnfortunately,
    the locals are not very friendly. You will undoubtedly get yourself into difficulties.
    When this happens, we will pull you back in an emergency extraction. There is
    a cost to this, but at least you will remain alive.\n\nThose of us that come
    with you will form a particle cloud that looks like a person. We'll try to help
    keep you safe by picking off a few of the enemy for you. We will also change
    colour to let you know how close you are to an emergency extraction.\n\nDon't
    worry about us though, we can't be harmed by the natives. Focus on keeping yourself
    safe and gathering those resources. "
