  script: "We had to pull you out, you were too close to true death. \n\nEmergency
    extractions only bring the essentials, you, the Nanobots with you and any resources
    you have collected. Everything else has to be left behind.\n\r\nWhile we reconstruct
    you take a look at your stats here. They can be useful in figuring out where
    you are strong or weak. This can help you decide which zone to target next."
