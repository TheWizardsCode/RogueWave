  script: "We now have resources and can make you stronger. Any upgrades you select
    here in the Hub are permanent. They will survive an emergency extraction. \n\nHowever,
    to build the portal generator we need specific kinds of crystal. \n\nWhen you
    have finished upgrading let us know by selecting the \"Prepare for Nanotransfer\"
    and we'll prepare for a new zone that we believe contains some of these special
    crystals."
