  script: "We can break you down into atoms and send you into zones across the planet
    to gather the resources we need. \n\nSome of us will stay here, where it is safe,
    others will come with you to help in the field. \n\nThose that stay can keep
    a link to you open for 5 minutes. After that amount of time we will Nanotransfer
    you back here."
