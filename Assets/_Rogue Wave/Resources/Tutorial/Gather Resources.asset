    first.\r\n\r\nGather resources from crystals, enemies and buildings in this sector.
    Be careful though. There's a spawner here. Spawners like this one are creating
    those things that killed your friends.  \n\nOnce it's shields and core are destroyed,
    then we can transfer you out.\r But don't worry if they beat you, we can rebuild
    you again.."
